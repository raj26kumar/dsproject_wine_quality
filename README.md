-Predicting Wine Quality with Several Classification Techniques

From the data set, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or "bad quality" (a score below 7)

# The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

        *Fixed acidity
        *Volatile acidity
        *Citric acid
        *Residual sugar
        *Chlorides
        *Free sulfur dioxide
        *Total sulfur dioxide
        *Density
        *pH
        *Sulfates
        *Alcohol

"our objective here is too see which classifiaction methose yeilds highest accuracy score and also to determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine"
